# SmartContractColorchanger

## Overview
`SmartContractColorchanger` is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to change the website's background color. The color change is facilitated through a smart contract deployed on a blockchain, and users can interact with it using the MetaMask extension.

## Features
- **Decentralized Color Change**: The application leverages blockchain technology to allow users to change the website's color in a decentralized manner.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Users can interact with the smart contract using the MetaMask browser extension, making the process seamless and user-friendly.
- **Solidity Smart Contract**: The core logic for the color change is implemented in a Solidity smart contract.

## How to Use
1. Visit the [SmartContractColorchanger website](https://tuduun.github.io/SmartContractColorchanger/).
2. If you wish to change the color, press the "set status" button. This will prompt you to pay a test asset via MetaMask.
3. To view the current color set by someone, press the "get status" button. The website background will change to the color set by the last user who paid.

## Code Structure
- **JavaScript Logic**: The [script.js]  file contains the frontend logic to interact with the smart contract and update the website's UI.
- **Smart Contract**: The [contract.sol] file contains the Solidity smart contract responsible for handling the color change logic on the blockchain.
